# FHIR Mapper

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/standardhealth/fhir-mapper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/standardhealth/fhir-mapper)

Library for mapping various forms of FHIR to mCODE by adding mCODE profiles onto the incoming FHIR. 

## Current Mappers
* Synthea FHIR => mCODE v0.5 (`src/mappers/SyntheaToV05.js`)
* Synthea FHIR => mCODE v0.9 (`src/mappers/SyntheaToV09.js`)
* Cerner Sandbox => mCODE v0.9 (`src/mappers/Cerner.js`)
* Open Epic DSTU2 FHIR => mCODE v0.9 (`src/mappers/OpenEpic.js`)

## Quickstart

Install into your project via yarn:

``` bash
$ yarn add fhir-mapper
```

Each mapper class will export a function `execute`, which takes in an array of FHIR resources and applies mapping to each resource.

In the file where the mapping needs to be done, import one of the supported mappers (e.g. Synthea) directly into the project. Here is an example of utilizing the Synthea mapper to add mCODE v0.9 profiles onto Synthea DSTU2 FHIR:

``` JavaScript
import { mappers } from 'fhir-mapper';

const { SyntheaToV09 } = mappers;
const mapper = new SyntheaToV09();

const json = {/* a Synthea FHIR Bundle */};

const resources = json.entry.map(e => e.resource);
const results = mapper.execute(resources);

// results is now an array of entries from the original Bundle with proper mapping
```

## Local Development

To get started with local development for testing or adding/modifying mappers, first clone and install the dependencies:

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/standardhealth/fhir-mapper.git
$ yarn install
```

### Link to Desired Repository

Use `yarn link` to pull in `fhir-mapper` as a module into a project:

1. From the `fhir-mapper` project root directory, run `yarn link`
2. Change directory to the desired project where this module will be installed
3. From that project's root directory, run `yarn link fhir-mapper`

Now, changes made to the `fhir-mapper` code will automatically be reflected in the project's `node_modules` directory and update accordingly.

### Writing a new mapper (example)

Cases may arise where one needs to write a new mapper (e.g. to a different version of mCODE or from different FHIR).

Create the new mapper in `src/mapping/mappers/<your-mapper>.js` and import the mapper module to build the mapper. The following is an example of what a mapper could look like for applying mCODE profiles:

``` JavaScript
/* src/mapping/mappers/<your-mapper>.js */

const { AggregateMapper } = require('../mapper');

const resourceMapping = {
    filter: () => true,
    ignore: () => {/* criteria for mapper to ignore */},
    default: (resource) => {/* default behavior */},
    mappers: [
        {
            filter: "<some fhirpath expression>",
            exec: (resource) => {/* return mapped resource */}
        },
        // other mappers...
    ]
};

export default class YourNewMapper extends AggregateMapper {
    constructor(variables = {}) {
        super(resourceMapping, variables);
    }
}
```

Lastly, add the new mapper to be exported by `src/mapping/mappers/index.js`:

``` JavaScript
// Other mappers
// ...
const YourNewMapper = require('./<your-mapper>.js'); // want to export new mapper to use in project

module.exports = {
    /* other mappers */
    YourNewMapper
};
```

Now, the new mapper will be available in the desired project:

``` JavaScript
/* other project's file that needs to do mapping */
import { yourNewMapper } from 'fhir-mapper';
// ...
yourNewMapper.execute(resources) // resources is an array of entries
```

### Linting

Before pushing a new mapper, ensure that there are no eslint errors by running the linter: `yarn lint`

### Standalone Usage

To apply mappings to a file standalone, a CLI option is included. 

Usage:
```
yarn map <mapper> <input> <output>
```
Where:
 - *mapper* - The name of the mapper to use to map the given files. Must be one of the mappers defined in `src/mapping/mappers/index.js`. Ex: `SyntheaToV09`
 - *input* - The path to a single FHIR JSON file or folder containing multiple FHIR JSON files to process.
 - *output* - The location to put the mapped file. If *input* is a folder, *output* should be a folder. Each processed file will have the same name as the unprocessed file in the output folder. *output* may be a single filename if *input* is a single filename.

 All three parameters are required.

 Sample:

 ```
$ yarn map SyntheaToV09 ~/synthea/output/fhir_dstu2/ output
Processing ~/synthea/output/fhir_dstu2/Aaron697_Corwin846_e97aaf5b-609c-4147-bf6f-921f45966f72.json
Wrote output/Aaron697_Corwin846_e97aaf5b-609c-4147-bf6f-921f45966f72.json

Processing ...
 ```
 
 ### Generating JavaScript for Web Apps
 
 If you are doing local development of `fhir-mapper` for a web app, you will need to use Webpack to bundle up and "babel-ify" the source code for the browser. To do so, use the following command:
 
 ```
 yarn webpack
 ```
 
 This will generate bundles in the `dist/` directory that can be imported into web apps without conflicts.
